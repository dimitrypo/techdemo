        %h2.section-heading Main challenges
        %ul
          %li
            Complicated design, done by very demanding professionals, constant design change, AB testing to ensure design is attractive for users. Overall site went through 5 complete redesigns over time I've worked on it.          
          %li
            12 mln users per month - project have to be bug free, even something with 0.1% chance of occurance will disturb workflow of thousands
          %li
            Out of dated computers - many still use I.E. 8, Opera Mobile by far the most popular browser. Site have to looks good both on modern devices and out dated equipment
          %li
            Demanding requirments for site rendering time - 0.2-0.5s for Time To First Byte. Extensive use of caching and deep optimizations to achieve that
          %li
            Millions of records in Database which should be accessible within a second or faster
          %li
            Site uptime should be 99.99% or thousands of users will be lost
          %li
            Constant hacking attempts - both servers and application should be rock solid
